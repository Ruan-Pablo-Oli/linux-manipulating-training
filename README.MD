# 🐧 Linux Manipulation Training

This project provides an interactive environment for practicing basic Linux commands in a practical and fun way, with a CTF (Capture the Flag)-style mission. At the end, you'll find a "treasure" hidden in the file system.

## 📁 Project structure

├── setup/  
│ └── setup.sh # Script that generates the training environment
<br>
└── linux-training/ # Directory created, where you practice the commands

-> The structure is already assembled, but if you want to reset everything to the initial state, just run the setup.sh script again!!!
